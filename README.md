# SUTRA SDK - Build on UTXO Blockchains with Elixir

A powerful Elixir SDK framework for building applications on UTXO-based blockchains. Leverage the BEAM virtual machine to create robust, concurrent blockchain applications.

## 🚀 Overview

SUTRA is designed for developers who want to build on UTXO-based blockchains using the power and reliability of Elixir and the BEAM virtual machine. With support for multiple blockchain networks and a focus on developer experience, SUTRA makes blockchain development accessible and efficient.

### Supported Blockchains

- **Cardano** - Full UTXO support with smart contract integration
- **Bitcoin** - Native Bitcoin protocol compatibility
- **Midnight** - Privacy-focused blockchain development

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **UI Components**: Modern, accessible component library
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Fonts**: JetBrains Mono & Fira Code for code display
